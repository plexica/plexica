| Role                | Super Admin (Platform Operations)                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Age range           | 32-48                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Goal                | Provision and manage tenant organizations across the platform with zero data leakage                                                                                                                                       |
| Pain points         | 1. Provisioning failures are opaque — unclear which step failed and why. 2. No visibility into deletion countdown or grace period status. 3. Switching between tenant list, details, and actions requires too many clicks. |
| Tech literacy       | High                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Quote               | _"I need to onboard 15 tenants this quarter. If provisioning fails, I need to know exactly what broke so I can fix it — not a generic error message."_                                                                     |

| Pain points         | 1. Cannot see a live preview of theme changes before saving. 2. Plugin configuration is scattered across multiple screens. 3. Unsure which settings are tenant-level vs. workspace-level. |

| Role                | Super Admin (Junior / On-Call)                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Pain points         | 1. Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions don't explain consequences clearly enough. 2. Hard to find the right tenant quickly when there are hundreds. 3. Accidental suspension is her biggest fear — no undo within the same flow. |

### Journey 1: Diana — Create a New Tenant Organization

**Trigger**: A new customer (Acme Corp) has signed their contract. Diana needs to provision their tenant so the customer can begin onboarding.

**Preconditions**:

- Diana is authenticated as Super Admin in the super-admin panel
- Diana is on the Tenants page (`/tenants`)
- At least one plugin is registered in the platform

#### Happy Path

| 12   | Clicks "View Tenant"                                  | Tenant detail modal opens showing full tenant info                                                                                                                       | 😊 Confirmed — can verify infrastructure               |

**Outcome**: Acme Corp tenant is fully provisioned with isolated schema, Keycloak realm, storage bucket, admin user invited, and selected plugins enabled.

**Delight opportunities**:

- Step 2: slug auto-generation from name saves manual work
- Step 8: live color swatch preview validates choice immediately
- Step 9: review step prevents errors before committing
- Step 10: per-step provisioning progress replaces an opaque spinner

#### Edge Case A: Duplicate Slug Conflict

**Trigger**: Diana enters a tenant name that generates a slug already in use.

**Recovery path**: Inline error on the slug field with a suggestion to modify. "Next" button disabled until slug validates.
**Feedback**: "A tenant with slug 'acme-corp' already exists. Try a different name or edit the slug."

#### Edge Case B: Provisioning Failure (Keycloak Down)

**Trigger**: Keycloak is unreachable during tenant provisioning. Schema creation succeeds but realm creation fails.

| Step | User Action                                      | System Response                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Emotional State                            |

**Recovery path**: "Retry" button pre-fills the wizard with the same data. Diana can also check Keycloak status and retry later.
**Feedback**: "Provisioning failed at step 'Create Keycloak Realm'. Keycloak service is unreachable. All created resources have been rolled back. You can retry when the service is available."

#### Edge Case C: Rollback Itself Fails

**Trigger**: Provisioning fails, and the automated rollback also fails (e.g., cannot delete partially-created schema).

| Step | User Action                                     | System Response                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Emotional State                                  |

**Recovery path**: Tenant is visible in list with PROVISIONING status + error indicator. Detail modal shows the specific error and manual cleanup instructions.
**Feedback**: "Provisioning failed and automatic rollback was unsuccessful. Manual cleanup required for: PostgreSQL schema 'tenant_acme_corp'."

### Journey 2: Diana — Manage Tenant Lifecycle (Suspend, Delete, Reactivate)

**Trigger**: Acme Corp has reported a security breach. Diana needs to immediately suspend the tenant to prevent further access, then later decide whether to reactivate or delete.

**Preconditions**:

- Diana is on the Tenants page
- Acme Corp tenant exists with ACTIVE status

#### Happy Path (Suspend → Delete → Reactivate within grace period)

| Step | User Action                                                                              | System Response                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Emotional State                          |

| 1    | Types "nonexistent-corp" in search bar | List empties. Empty state: illustration + "No tenants found matching 'nonexistent-corp'. Try a different search term or clear filters." CTA: "Clear search" button. | 😕 Confused — did I spell it wrong? |
| 2    | Clicks "Clear search"                  | Search clears. Full tenant list restored.                                                                                                                           | 😊 Recovered                        |

**Empty state copy**:

- Body: "No tenants match your current search or filter criteria."
- CTA label: "Clear filters"

| 2    | Corrects to "https://acme.com/logo.png" | Validation passes. Green checkmark. Preview attempts to load image.                                                               | 😊 Relieved                                       |

### Journey 4: Mei — Emergency Tenant Suspension (On-Call)

**Trigger**: Mei receives a PagerDuty alert at 2:15 AM about suspicious activity on tenant "beta-testing-org". She needs to suspend it immediately.

**Preconditions**:

- Mei is authenticated as Super Admin
- She has the tenant slug from the alert: "beta-testing-org"

#### Happy Path

| Step | User Action                                                      | System Response                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Emotional State                    |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| 1    | Opens super-admin panel on laptop                                | Dashboard loads. Clicks "Tenants" in sidebar.                                                                                                                                                                            | 😐 Alert — on-call mode            |
| 2    | Types "beta-testing" in search bar                               | Real-time filter narrows to 1 result. Tenant "Beta Testing Org" visible with ACTIVE badge.                                                                                                                               | 😊 Relieved — found it fast        |
| 3    | Clicks "Suspend" button directly from list row                   | Confirmation dialog: "Suspend 'Beta Testing Org'? All 47 active users will be immediately locked out." Two buttons: "Cancel" and "Suspend Tenant". No slug-typing required (lower friction for suspension vs. deletion). | 🤔 Double-checking — right tenant? |
| 4    | Verifies tenant name and slug in dialog, clicks "Suspend Tenant" | Toast: "Tenant 'Beta Testing Org' suspended." Row updates immediately.                                                                                                                                                   | 🎉 Relieved — threat contained     |

**Outcome**: Tenant suspended in under 10 seconds from landing on the page. All tenant users receive 403 on next request.

**Delight opportunities**:

- Step 2: search is instant (client-side filter + debounced API)
- Step 3: suspension confirmation shows user count to increase confidence in the right target
- Step 3: suspension does NOT require typing the slug (lower friction than delete)

#### Edge Case A: Suspending the Wrong Tenant (Near-Miss)

**Trigger**: Mei nearly suspends the wrong tenant because two tenants have similar names.

| Step | User Action                                      | System Response                                                                                                                        | Emotional State              |

| 1    | Types "beta" in search                           | Two results: "Beta Corp" and "Beta Testing Org"                                                                                        | 🤔 Uncertain — which one?    |
| 2    | Clicks "Suspend" on "Beta Corp" (wrong one)      | Confirmation dialog shows: tenant name "Beta Corp", slug "beta-corp", status ACTIVE, user count "12 active users". Mei reads the slug. | 😰 Close call — almost wrong |
| 3    | Clicks "Cancel"                                  | Dialog closes. No action taken.                                                                                                        | 😊 Relieved — caught it      |
| 4    | Clicks "Suspend" on "Beta Testing Org" (correct) | Dialog shows correct slug "beta-testing-org" and "47 active users"                                                                     | 😊 Confident                 |
| 5    | Clicks "Suspend Tenant"                          | Toast: "Tenant 'Beta Testing Org' suspended."                                                                                          | 🎉 Relieved                  |

**Recovery path**: Confirmation dialog shows enough identifying information (name, slug, user count) to catch mistakes before committing.

| 3    | Confirms                                | Toast: "Invitation resent to admin@acme.com." Button changes to "Invitation Sent" (disabled) with timestamp.         | 😊 Done — simple action |

**Outcome**: Admin receives new invitation email and can complete onboarding.

| ---- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 1-2  | Same as happy path         | —                                                                                                                                                           | —                                  |
| 3    | Clicks "Resend Invitation" | Toast (warning): "Invitation email could not be sent. The email service may be temporarily unavailable. Try again in a few minutes." Button remains active. | 😤 Frustrated — but knows to retry |

**Feedback**: "Invitation email could not be sent. The email service may be temporarily unavailable. Try again in a few minutes."
