| Goal                | Install, update, and manage plugins across the platform with confidence that nothing breaks tenant environments                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Pain points         | 1. Blind installs — no visibility into what's happening during plugin setup (image pull, migrations, health). 2. State confusion — unclear which plugins are truly running vs. just registered. 3. Tenant impact anxiety — afraid that enabling/disabling a plugin will disrupt active tenants |

| Pain points         | 1. Configuration complexity — JSON Schema config forms are intimidating without clear labels and help text. 2. No preview — cannot see what a plugin does before enabling it for his team. 3. Data loss fear — worried that disabling a plugin will delete tenant-specific data |

#### Edge Case A: Image Pull Failure

**Trigger**: The container image URL in the manifest is incorrect or the registry is unreachable.

| Step | User Action                                     | System Response                                                                                                                                                                   | Emotional State                     |

**Recovery path**: User can retry the install (button visible below error), or dismiss and fix the manifest, then re-register with corrected image URL.
**Feedback**: "Image pull failed: `registry.example.com/crm:1.0.0` — Connection refused. Verify the image URL in your manifest and ensure the registry is accessible."

### Journey 2: Dana — Manage Plugin Lifecycle (Enable / Disable / Update / Uninstall)

**Trigger**: Dana needs to enable an installed plugin, later disable it for maintenance, update it to a new version, or uninstall it entirely.

**Preconditions**:

- Dana is logged in as Super Admin
- At least one plugin is in INSTALLED state

**Preconditions**:

- Marcus is logged in as Tenant Admin
- CRM Plugin is globally ACTIVE
- Marcus has `tenant_admin` role

#### Happy Path

**Outcome**: CRM plugin is enabled for Marcus's tenant with custom configuration. Team members can now access CRM features based on their roles.

**Delight opportunities**:

- Step 5: Show field-level help text from JSON Schema `description` property
- Step 6: Smart defaults populated from JSON Schema `default` values
- Step 7: "Test configuration" option that validates against the plugin's API

#### Edge Case A: Configuration Validation Error

**Trigger**: Marcus enters an invalid value in the configuration form.

**Feedback**: "Deal Stages is required. Add at least one stage for your sales pipeline."

#### Edge Case B: Plugin Not Available (Globally Disabled)

**Trigger**: Marcus looks for a plugin that the Super Admin has disabled globally.

| Step | User Action               | System Response                                                                                                                                 | Emotional State                |
| ---- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 1    | Navigates to "Extensions" | Extensions page loads. The plugin Marcus is looking for does not appear in the list (only globally ACTIVE plugins are shown)                    | 😕 Confused — where is it?     |
| 2    | Searches or scrolls       | No results. If no plugins are enabled globally, empty state: "No extensions available. Contact your platform administrator to request plugins." | 😐 Informed — knows who to ask |

**Message**: "No extensions available for your organization. Contact your platform administrator to request new extensions."

---

#### Edge Case C: Permission Denied — Non-Admin User

**Trigger**: A regular user (not tenant admin) tries to access the Extensions page.

| Step | User Action                            | System Response                                                                                                                                   | Emotional State     |

**Message**: "You don't have permission to manage extensions. Only organization administrators can enable and configure plugins. Contact your admin if you need access."

### Journey 4: Priya — Register and Monitor Plugin (Developer View via Super Admin)

**Trigger**: Priya has finished building a new Analytics plugin and wants to register it on the platform to test.

**Preconditions**:

- Priya has Super Admin access (developer with admin privileges)
- Plugin manifest is prepared
- Container image is pushed to the registry

#### Happy Path

| Step | User Action                                                 | System Response                                                                                                                                                                                  | Emotional State                    |

| 6    | Navigates to Plugin Detail view                             | Detail view shows: lifecycle status timeline, health check status (polling every 30s), events published/subscribed, permissions registered, tenant adoption count (0 initially), manifest viewer | 😊 Satisfied — full visibility     |

**Outcome**: Priya can register, install, enable, and monitor her plugin with full visibility into every lifecycle step and runtime health.

**Delight opportunities**:

- Step 2: Syntax highlighting in the JSON editor with autocomplete for known manifest fields
- Step 6: Real-time health status with last-checked timestamp and response time

---

#### Edge Case A: Manifest Validation Failure

**Trigger**: Priya's manifest has structural errors.

| Step | User Action                                       | System Response                                                                                                                                                                                       | Emotional State                         |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |

| 3    | Fixes errors one by one                           | Each fix clears the corresponding error in real-time. Error count decreases: "2 errors → 1 error → ✓ Valid"                                                                                           | 😊 Relieved — progressive feedback      |

**Feedback**: Validation errors include JSON path, expected value, and actual value. Example: "Field `runtime.type`: expected 'typescript', got 'python'. Only TypeScript plugins are supported (ADR-003)."
