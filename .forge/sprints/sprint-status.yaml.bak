      ✅ Sprint 1 CLOSED (2026-02-15)

      Outstanding Success:
      - Backend i18n system 100% complete (Milestones 1-5)
      - 218 comprehensive tests implemented (100% pass rate)
      - @plexica/i18n package: 115 tests, 94.9% coverage
      - core-api i18n module: ≥85% coverage (exceeds target)
      - 6 critical security fixes applied post-M4 adversarial review
      - All 14 functional requirements implemented (backend)
      - All 5 non-functional requirements met
      - Zero constitution violations after fixes

      Carried Over:
      - E01-S006 (Frontend Integration, 5 pts) → Sprint 2
      - Rationale: Backend is production-ready; frontend deserves focused sprint

      Key Achievements:
      - Security: 3 CRITICAL + 3 WARNING issues identified and fixed
      - Testing: Comprehensive test suite with unit, integration, and security tests
      - Architecture: FormatJS integration with compile-time optimization
      - Performance: Redis caching, content-hashed URLs for immutable assets
      - Compliance: Constitution Article 1.2, 5.1, 5.3, 6.3 violations resolved
