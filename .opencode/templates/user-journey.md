## 2. User Journeys

<!-- For each persona, map the primary journey and at least 2 edge cases. -->

---

### Journey 1: [Persona 1 Name] — [Journey Name / Goal]

**Trigger**: [What makes this persona start this journey? What event or need
prompts them to open the app/page?]

**Preconditions**:
- [System state or user state required before this journey starts]
- [e.g., "User is logged in", "Cart has at least one item"]

#### Happy Path

| Step | User Action | System Response | Emotional State |
|------|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 1 | [What the user does] | [What the system shows/does] | 😐 Neutral |
| 2 | | | 😤 Frustrated |
| 3 | | | 🤔 Uncertain |
| 4 | | | 😊 Relieved |
| 5 | | | 🎉 Satisfied |

**Outcome**: [What success looks like. What has changed for the user?]

**Delight opportunities**: [Steps where you could exceed expectations. E.g.,
autofill, smart defaults, helpful microcopy.]

---

#### Edge Case A: Error / Failure

**Trigger**: [What went wrong? API failure, validation error, network timeout, etc.]

| Step | User Action | System Response | Emotional State |
|------|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 1 | [same as happy path until failure point] | | |
| N | [failure trigger] | [Error message, inline or modal] | 😡 Frustrated |
| N+1 | [user recovery action] | [Recovery option presented] | 😐 Trying again |

**Recovery path**: [How does the user recover? Is there an undo? A retry?]
**Feedback**: [Exact error message text. Be specific.]

---

#### Edge Case B: Empty State

**Trigger**: [User arrives at a screen with no data. First use, filtered to zero
results, or content has been deleted.]

| Step | User Action | System Response | Emotional State |
|------|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 1 | [arrives at screen] | [Empty state shown: illustration + message + CTA] | 😐 Neutral |
| 2 | [clicks CTA] | [directed to create/import/discover content] | 😊 Guided |

**Empty state copy**:
- Heading: "[e.g., No items yet]"
- Body: "[Explain why it's empty and what to do]"
- CTA label: "[e.g., Add your first item]"

---

#### Edge Case C: Permission Denied *(if applicable)*

**Trigger**: [User tries to access a feature or resource they are not allowed to.]

| Step | User Action | System Response | Emotional State |
|------|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 1 | [attempts action] | [Permission denied message or redirect] | 😕 Confused |
| 2 | [asks why / reads message] | [Explanation of required permissions] | 😐 Informed |

**Message**: [Exact copy of the permission-denied message. Avoid "Access
denied" — explain what they need and how to get it.]

---

### Journey 2: [Persona 2 Name] — [Journey Name / Goal]

**Preconditions**:

#### Happy Path

| Step | User Action | System Response | Emotional State |
